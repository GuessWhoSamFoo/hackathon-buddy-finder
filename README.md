## Hackathon Buddy Finder

[BCHacks](http://www.bchacks.com/) organized a hackathon for students in December 2016. This wasn't a typical hackathon in terms of presenting ideas and forming teams from strangers right there on the spot. On the contrary, most students came with their own teams and projects that they have been working for a while. Just couple lonely souls found themselves without a team or a project since the BCHAcks was advertised as a place that anyone is welcome. That's when **Team LeftOvers** was born as well as the idea to write a simple app that will allow you to find a team during a busy hackathon. 

During the hackathon we practiced paired programming and worked in 2 pairs:

* [Aaron](https://github.com/AaronDean) and [Bogdan](https://github.com/bpshonyak) worked on the front-end part of the site: from CSS to JavaScript, layout, content, design.

* [Sam](https://github.com/GuessWhoSamFoo) and [Anya](https://github.com/cherchezlafemme) were responsible for the back-end side: setting up the environment, database and writing custom methods in Python to ensure the working system.

## Technology used:
  Python, Flask, Javascript, HTML, CSS, AJAX, sqlite3

## Running the app:

* Export the FLASK_APP environment variable: 
``` export FLASK_APP=hackathonbuddyfinder.py ```

* Run the server on your machine:
``` flask run ```  or 
``` python -m flask run ```

* Visit your app at 
``` http://127.0.0.1:5000/ ```
